## What is OpenClaw?

### Headline
**The AI That Actually Does Things**

OpenClaw isn't a chatbot. It's an autonomous AI assistant that connects to your computer, apps, and workflows. It clears your inbox, manages your calendar, writes code, books flights, and runs on autopilot 24/7. It's the most popular open-source AI assistant in the world—and for good reason.

**What people are doing with OpenClaw:**
- "It's running my company."
- "After years of AI hype, this is the first time I've felt like I'm living in the future."
- "OpenClaw is a 24/7 assistant with access to its own computer... That's the future, and we're living it today."

## The Problem (Light Version)

### Headline
**The Setup Wall**

OpenClaw is incredible. Getting it running is not.

Most people hit the wall at API keys, OAuth flows, or server configuration. The hard part isn't deploying OpenClaw—it's connecting it to Gmail, Slack, your calendar, and everything else you actually use. That's where 99% of people give up.
